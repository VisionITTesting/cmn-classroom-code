###Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
1. Checked Exception: The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2. Unchecked Exception: The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.

3. Error : Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
